## Why did I choose SWIGGY API ? Instead of some dummy free API avialable online?

- To exhibit my ability to handle and properly integrate real world API .
- Images are always available in optimised quality in this API .
- No matter what the data is , I intented to exhibit my ability to manage state properly using redux tolkit and my abilities to create symmetric , clean & accessible web application. 

## Optimizations

- Added "priority" attribute to <Image/> tags where image was LCP element .
- Improved accesibility from 79 to 91 , by adding proper aria-label to Links and Buttons and using semantic HTML .
